                        <h2 class="h4 text-primary">Cannonborough-Elliotborough</h2>
                        <p>This is the "Short-Term Rental Capital" of downtown. While much of the historic district forbids Airbnbs under 30 days, this neighborhood is the exception. It is the gold mine for bachelorette parties.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Vibe:</strong> Walkable, trendy, and packed with local flavor. You’re 3 blocks from the bars of Upper King Street. You’ll find restored wood-fronted houses that have been converted into luxury rental suites.</p>

                        <h2 class="h4 text-primary">Folly Beach</h2>
                        <p>If you want the "classic" bachelorette party experience—big houses, beach access, and a laid-back atmosphere—Folly is the place. It's about a 20-minute Uber from downtown.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Vibe:</strong> Surfer-cool and unpretentious. Look for rentals near Center Street so you can walk to bars like Surf Bar or Taco Boy. It's the best spot for groups who want a private pool and ocean views.</p>

                        <h2 class="h4 text-primary">Park Circle (North Charleston)</h2>
                        <p>The "Brooklyn" of Charleston. This is the best value for groups who want to save money on the house to spend more on the experiences.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Vibe:</strong> Craft breweries, disc golf, and a killer main street (East Montague Ave). It’s about 15 minutes north of downtown but offers much larger homes for a fraction of the price.</p>

                        <h2 class="h4 text-primary">Mount Pleasant / Shem Creek</h2>
                        <p>A sophisticated middle ground. Staying near Shem Creek gives you waterfront dining and easy access to both downtown and the beaches of Sullivan's Island.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Vibe:</strong> Boat charters leave from here daily. It’s perfect for the group that wants to spend Saturday on a fishing boat and Saturday night at a high-end steakhouse.</p>

            <h3>Pro-Tip: Check the "Occupancy"</h3>
            <p>Charleston is cracking down on over-crowded rentals. If a listing says "Sleeps 12," make sure it actually has 12 beds, not 4 beds and 4 air mattresses. For the best experience, look for <strong>"The Palmetto State Complex"</strong> or similar properties that allow you to book multiple units in one footprint. This keeps the group together without violating local fire codes or noise ordinances.</p>
