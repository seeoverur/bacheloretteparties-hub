        <p class="lead">Charleston has three distinct beaches. Here is how to pick the right one for your Charleston <a href="https://bacheloretteparties.blog">bachelorette parties trip</a></p>
    </header>

    <div class="container my-5">
        <div class="row text-center g-5">
            <div class="col-md-4">
                <div class="beach-icon">🏄‍♂️</div>
                <h3>Folly Beach</h3>
                <p class="text-primary fw-bold">"The Edge of America"</p>
                <p><strong>Best For:</strong> The Rowdy Crew. Folly is the classic surf town. It has the most bars, the most personality, and the closest proximity to downtown. Spend your morning at "The Washout" watching surfers, and your afternoon at <strong>The Pier</strong>.</p>
                <p><strong>The Move:</strong> Rent a golf cart, grab frozen daiquiris at Zach's Daiqs, and post up for a game of Spikeball near the dunes.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-md-4">
                <div class="beach-icon">🍔</div>
                <h3>Sullivan's Island</h3>
                <p class="text-primary fw-bold">"The Foodie Retreat"</p>
                <p><strong>Best For:</strong> The Refined Group. Sullivan’s is more residential and exclusive. You won't find neon signs or high-rises here. It’s the perfect place for a low-key beach day followed by an incredible meal.</p>
                <p><strong>The Move:</strong> Stake out a spot on the sand, then walk to <strong>Poe’s Tavern</strong> for the best burgers in the state or <strong>The Obstinate Daughter</strong> for world-class seafood pizza.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-md-4">
                <div class="beach-icon">⛳</div>
                <h3>Isle of Palms (IOP)</h3>
                <p class="text-primary fw-bold">"The Resort Vibe"</p>
                <p><strong>Best For:</strong> The Golf & Beach Hybrid. IOP is home to Wild Dunes resort. It’s wide, clean, and polished. If your group is staying in Mount Pleasant, this is your easiest beach access.</p>
                <p><strong>The Move:</strong> Catch live music at <strong>The Windjammer</strong>—a beachfront bar that defines the summer experience in Charleston. If you have golfers in the group, play a round at the Links Course before heading to the water.</p>

                    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>No Alcohol on the Sand:</strong> This is strictly enforced. Keep it in your rental or stick to the beachfront bars.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Parking is War:</strong> If you aren't on the sand by 10:30 AM on a Saturday, you aren't parking within a mile of the ocean. Uber is highly recommended.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Leave No Trace:</strong> Charlestonians are protective of their coastline. Pick up your cans and keep the dunes clean.</li>
